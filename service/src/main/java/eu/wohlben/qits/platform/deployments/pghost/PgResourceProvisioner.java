/**
 * The sole production implementation of {@link ResourceProvisioner}: plain JDBC against the
 * platform's postgres, as the administrator, over the driver this component already carries for its
 * own store.
 *
 * <p><b>No second datasource, on purpose.</b> Agroal pools are for a store this process owns; this
 * is a handful of idempotent statements against somebody else's server, run once per deployment, at
 * an address derived per deployment. A {@link DriverManager} connection opened and closed around
 * them is the honest shape, and it keeps the admin credential out of every datasource-shaped
 * surface a config dump would print.
 *
 * <p><b>Autocommit stays on, and it has to.</b> {@code CREATE DATABASE} cannot run inside a
 * transaction block — postgres refuses it outright — so this converges statement by statement. Each
 * statement is idempotent on its own, which is what makes a half-finished run safe to repeat.
 *
 * <p><b>DDL cannot be parametrized, so the identifiers are re-validated immediately before the
 * string is assembled.</b> That is the health-path stance applied to the one place it matters most:
 * everything here is repository-authored input reaching a server the whole platform shares. The
 * existence checks below ARE parametrized — they read {@code pg_catalog}, where a bind variable is
 * available and therefore mandatory.
 *
 * <p><b>No statement containing a password is ever logged</b>, not at debug and not in a failure
 * detail. What is logged is the shape of what happened: which role, which database, which arm.
