 * <p>Nothing in the build notification names an image; the reference is <em>derived</em> from the
 * application's name and the commit sha, which makes the tag convention a contract the publisher
 * has to meet rather than a value someone forgot to send. The registry host here is the one the
 * <b>docker daemon</b> resolves (it does the pulling), not one this process dials.
